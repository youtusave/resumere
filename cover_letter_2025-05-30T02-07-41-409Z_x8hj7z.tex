I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Junior Software Engineer position at Lindtre. As a BCIT CST Diploma candidate, graduating in December 2024, I have gained valuable experience in software development through internships and personal projects. My background in building and optimizing backend systems, coupled with my proficiency in various technologies, makes me confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your team.

\vspace{10pt}
During my software engineering internship at BCITRA, I streamlined administrative and communication processes for over 500 organization members. By leveraging Node.js, Express.js, and AWS RDS with MySQL, along with JavaScript and Chart.js for the frontend, I improved efficiency by 40% and sped up processes by 30%. Similarly, as a Software Engineering Intern at WALLIT, I architected the backend using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, which was successfully integrated with a React Native frontend. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to design, develop, and deploy robust and scalable applications.

\vspace{10pt}
I am particularly drawn to Lindtre because of its commitment to innovation and its reputation for fostering a collaborative environment. I am eager to apply my skills to challenging projects and contribute to the company's continued success. I am also curious about the team structure within the engineering department and the opportunities for junior engineers to collaborate with senior members on complex projects. Furthermore, what are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for this role, and how does the team measure success?
