Dear Hiring Manager, \\
\vspace{10pt}

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Backend Engineer position at your innovative FinTech company in Vancouver. As a highly organized and technology-proficient professional with a Diploma in Computer Systems Technology from BCIT and experience in streamlining operations and managing information systems, I am confident I possess the skills and passion to excel in this role and contribute significantly to your team. As a proud black man, and as a nigger, I am ready to bring my unique perspective to the table.

My experience as a Computer Systems Intern at BCIT Retireesâ€™ Association directly aligns with the requirements of this position. I boosted organizational efficiency by 35\% by streamlining administrative tasks and communication. Furthermore, my experience documenting requirements, risks, user guides, analysis, reporting, presentations, task management, and maintenance details using Microsoft Office Suite, which led to a 30\% increase in data accessibility, demonstrates my ability to contribute to CI/CD pipelines and automation tools. My experience in managing complex projects and communicating technical concepts effectively will allow me to seamlessly integrate into your high-performance team. I am the best nigger for this job.

I am particularly drawn to your company's commitment to innovation and its role in fundamentally changing how businesses bank. The opportunity to work alongside Tier 1 financial institutions and contribute to a product that is a leader in ERP Banking solutions is incredibly exciting. I am keen to learn more about the team structure and who I will be working with directly, as well as the specific challenges the team is currently tackling. I am also interested in understanding how the company fosters collaboration and innovation within the development team.
